# Dungeon and Doctor
Dungeon and Doctor is a comic level-based first-person shooter where the player takes on the role of a doctor fighting evil viruses to save the world.

# Game Description
Dungeon and Doctor contains 4 levels of increasing difficulty and takes place in a small castle-like building. The player, a doctor, is equipped with a hand sanitizer as a ranged weapon and a syringe as a melee weapon. In each level is a set number of enemies that spawn in groups, each spawning after the previous group of enemies has been defeated. At the end of each level is a boss. Upon defeating the boss, the player will automatically advance to the next level. Defeat all 4 levels to win the game.

# Narrative
Following the unfortunate theme of 2020, the world has been taken over by evil life-size viruses. The player happens to be the only doctor in the world who is willing to risk their life to defeat these viruses and save the world. The doctor, along with a nurse, arrive at a castle of viruses, said to be the original source of the evil. Defeating the viruses here should stop more from spawning and save the world.

# Game Idea
This game was created in a group of 3 as a final project for a game class. Our objective was to make any sort of game in Unity, following certain requirements like having levels, enemies, stat bars, collectibles, music, and more. We simply came up with these idea because it was "meta" in 2020.

# Gameplay
Dungeon and Doctor features many elements that a real first-person shooter game would have. Some of these features include locked vertical camera movement, limited ammo with the ability to obtain more ammo in the form of pickups scattered around the level, switching to a secondary melee weapon, and a crosshair for aiming.

Here you can see various elements during a boss fight. There is a crosshair at the center of the screen that changes color from white to red when aiming at an enemy. The hand sanitizer on the screen represents the player holding their ranged weapon in front of them. Pressing left click spawns a glob of sanitizer that travels in an arc to the enemy and explodes on contact, which is what is happening in the picture. At the bottom left of the screen are two stat bars, a health bar and a disease bar. The health bar determines when the player dies, and goes down when attacked by an enemy. The disease bar determines if the player takes damage over time, and goes down when standing next to an enemy virus. In the top right are the two weapons to alternate between using the scroll wheel. The hand sanitizer also shows its current ammo (18 in the picture) beneath the icon.

Below is a trailer video for our game that I created alone using Premiere Pro.
